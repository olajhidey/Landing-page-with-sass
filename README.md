# Landing Page with SASS

I am pretty new to the whole new SASS of a thing not until i subscribed to this youtube channel [DesignCourse](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVyRiMvfUNMA1UPlDPzG5Ow).

>Don't mind my writing

So basically this project was built with:

1. Sass
2. HTML
3. CSS

It's just a play around template with Sass and building my first Landing Page
